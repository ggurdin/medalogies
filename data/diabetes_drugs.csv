"I had been taking this drug for more than 5 years. Last year Januvia was added, because the Actosplus Met was insufficient to adequately lower my blood sugar. For the entire time, I have been unable to lose weight, although my daily calorie consumption is about 1000. I've had extreme fatigue, aches and pains, urinary urgency, carb cravings, and diarrhea. 2 weeks ago I reported to my doctor that my FBG was over 250. He replaced the Januvia with Farxiga. He also sent me to get a cardiac CT scan due to my family history. Since the dye used in the test, combined with metformin can cause lactic acidosis, I couldn't take my Actosplus Met for 2 days. By the second day, I felt great. My FBG was under 170 using just the Farxiga. My aches and pains went away, and the weight just started dropping off. 15 days later, I have lost 11 lbs, my FBG is under 150, I am no longer retaining fluid, and I feel 10 times better. This is only my experience, but there is no way I am ever taking this drug again. I can't believe I've spent 5 years wondering why I couldn't lose weight, no matter how little I ate. A diabetes drug with these side effects should never have been approved by the FDA. Its existence is some kind of cosmic joke on diabetics. I don't know if the drug manufacturer is negligent or inept. A diabetes drug that causes weight gain and aches and pains bad enough to prevent exercise would certainly ensure people have to keep taking it. I have hope that without this drug that I can keep losing weight through diet and exercise and that my numbers will continue to improve. I believe that CT scan may have saved my life, although not in the way it was intended. Your experience may be completely different than mine, but if you are suffering from these side effects, see your doctor. If he or she dismisses your concerns, find another doctor. It's your life, after all.","{'effectiveness': 3.0, 'ease of use': 2.0, 'satisfaction': 1.0}",8/21/2015 4:46:45 PM,Actoplus MET oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-94140-Actoplus-MET-oral.aspx?drugid=94140&drugname=Actoplus-MET-oral&pageIndex=0&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"This was a terrible drug and I regret allowing my Dr. to switch me from Metformin (which worked extremely well for me)to ActoplusMet 15/500.
1.)It did NOT control my blood sugar nearly as well as Metformin and my A1c number crept up gradually over the 4 years I was on it, from 5.6 to 6.9.
2.) I gained over 35 pounds in spite of consistent exercise and a pretty darn good dietary regimen.
3.) I began to be suspicious of the early signs of congestive heart failure and possible coronary artery disease which was confirmed by a recent stress EKG and subsequent angiogram.
These problems all took place in spite of good cholesterol numbers in the 135 - 145 range and LDL numbers below 70.
I insisted my doctor take me off Actoplus and went back to plain Metformin about 7 months ago and since then have dropped almost 25 pounds. I'm also seeing huge improvements in my blood glucose readings.  I am absolutely convinced that I got off Actoplus in the nick of time to avoid needing full-blown open heart surgery (at least for now) and am attempting to deal with the CAD with aggressive heart medications, continued exercise and diet ... we'll see over the next year whether or not this works.
Unfotunately there's no way to prove one way or the other that Actoplus is the culprit with resect to the heart issues, but I'm a student of my own body and I'm thoroughly convinced it's the primary cause. The added fact that it did a terrible job controlling my blood sugar, which was the sole reason for taking it in the first place makes it a failed experiment as far as I'm concerned.  It may work for others but it was a disaster for me.

"Started taking the medication and my numbers dropped in half. However less than 6 months on the medication along with trying to eat right and exercise. I now am right back at the higher numbers. The side effects are wrecking havoc for me.

I now have numbness along most of my right side. Hand, arm leg and some feet. Huge pain across shoulders as well. Did not injure self at all. But never had issue till took medication.

I had to change from night to morning because the pill dipped me too low in the mornings. Now it does nothing for system.

Use to be 85 in afternoon when got home after taking in the morning. Now I see 180 plus waking up. And recently after numbness set in I am now back in the 200 range.

Would not call this pill a success. Also would not recommend for anyone who has Seizure meds to take. This med has put me in many uneasy feelings. Not had any on floor events, but this med does not help. I have had almost every ""severe"" side effect from this medication. All on just 2 MG of medication once a day.

Sad I took this because it seems all diabetes meds only work for a short time and then are no longer useful to my system. Yeah for all of you who can take the cheap medication. Also I have gained 15 pounds in just 3 months time. Not looking forward to seeing how much more I gained in this past 3 months.

I also take this along with 1K metformin as well. I have tried so many different medications and had bad side effects that I am not sure where to go from here. May just need to look into more natural ways of controlling health.

When I was diagnosed they started me out on Metformin & Byetta.  Over time the Byetta made me so nauseous I asked to switch; they changed me to Actos and I gained 30 lbs. in 3 months.  Then I learned that can be common in some patients.  On Amaryl/Glimepiride for about 6 months & I began to lose the Actos fat right away.  Got injured in a horse accident & while in hospital they increased my Amaryl dose from 3 to 4 mg. in the AM.  Oddly once I got home my fasting blood sugar in the AM was higher than it was before they upped the dosage.  Now that I'm feeling stronger & getting more exercise it is really working for me again & steady weight loss is continuing.  So it surprised me to see so many comments about it causing weight GAIN.  I DO have occasional symptoms of LOW blood sugar on Amaryl which seems weird because my problem has be hyPERglycemia.  But symptoms are not so severe as to cause distress/concern - just have a little sugar if it gets too low.  I've had readings around 70 on occasion and that never happened on Byetta or Actos.  ,"{'effectiveness': 5.0, 'ease of use': 4.0, 'satisfaction': 4.0}",9/29/2011 10:31:16 AM,Amaryl oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-12297-Amaryl-oral.aspx?drugid=12297&drugname=Amaryl-oral&pageIndex=4&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"Started on 2 mg / day about 2 to 3 weeks ago and had to adjust down to 1 mg due to MANY hypo's. a1c is down from 8.2 to 6.6 over the last two months since starting in late December originally on glipizide for glucose control. Have discovered that once taken in the morning WITH food as instructed, pancreas goes into 'make insulin like crazy and pump into system irregardless mode' of constant carb intake (or not). Seems I BETTER NOT slowdown on carbs AT ALL (as opposed to trying to LOWER carbs..I HAVE TO keep them coming in or i'll end up with a hypo)! This means constant glucose test test test much more than doc prescribed of 4 times a day into upwards of 6 and that taxes the testing supplies wayyyyyyyy too much. Although having 'better' results because of knowing what to expect with glimeperide as opposed to glipizide XL which hits like a nuke but waits and waits until it hits, I would love suggestions and help finding a glucose control med that doesn't have to be monitored THIS MUCH so I don't go hypo so easily.  I thought the idea is to REDUCE carb and sugar intake NOT have to drink sugary juices and the like throughout the day and hit the glucose tablets twice to three times a day when the meter drops near or just below 70 almost on a regular basis seems around mid afternoon to early eve depleting the testing supplies wayyy too rapidly to 'keep up' with the med's over-effectiveness (even at my 1 mg level) throughout the day.  The warnings on side effects are dead-on especially on the beta-blocker masking some of the hypo's oncoming symptoms since I am also on two high-blood meds which are working just fine. All of these lows have initiated GAD which I have to watch for onset when a hypo hits now and have had to be placed on ativan for that!

"At 39 yrs old my menstrual cycle stopped.  Blood work showed an elevated prolactin level (30)but an MRI showed nothing .  I had no intention of having children so I did not go on any medication. 2 years later is was (59) & just recently up to (89)& the MRI found a 5mm adenoma.  I attributed a bit of hair thinning to my hormonal imbalance.  I started on 2.5 mg of Bromocriptine.  Within 4 weeks I could tell I was ovulating on my right side & I experienced the cervical mucus discharge associated with ovulation, only the discharge was quite heavy.  My breasts became extremely soar & tender to the touch.  Removing my bra at the end of the day was torturous as the sensitivity to my areola & nipples felt like they were raw & bruised, however looked completely normal.  My breasts remained engorged & tender.  And I experienced my first mensus in 4 years.  Light, & lasted only 2 days. My doctor raised the dosage to 5mg.  My levels dropped to (35).  My next period came 23 days later.  The ovulation stage was similar except the mucus discharge was even heavier! Upon the arrival of my 2nd period the cramping was painful, the flow was heavy & my breasts were extremely dense, fibrous, heavy & soar.  Unbearably so.  The period lasted a week.  Only one week later did I start experiencing the ovulation, discharge & painful lumpy breasts again.  This brings us to today.

I had my blood drawn today so now is the waiting game to see if the medication worked. If not I know there is a chance of having the Gamma Knife procedure. Has anyone else had this? I know there are very few places that perform it in the US. I will give an update soon of how the Bromocriptine affected my prolactin level. I have not experienced many bad side effects. Mainly nausea when i wake up in the mornings. ,"{'effectiveness': 2.0, 'ease of use': 4.0, 'satisfaction': 3.0}",10/14/2008 11:14:42 AM,bromocriptine oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-5565-bromocriptine-oral.aspx?drugid=5565&drugname=bromocriptine-oral&pageIndex=8&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

My stomach looks like it was hit with paintballs because the healed injection sites have turned light brown . Bydureon is very expensive out of pocket, most insurances do not cover it and  if they do, it's Tier 4 or ""Specialty Drug""  with a hefty co-pay. Heard Victoza works as well, is less expensive, but downside is it requires daily injections instead of once weekly . I read that thyroid scans and calcitonin levels should be monitored while on Bydureon. Not sure if that is correct, but am sure going to ask my doctor about it. I'm eager to see the effect Bydureon has had on my next A1C in Sept 2013.

Spoke to my nutritionist who had me review my diet and said I was not eating enough carbs. The nutritional counseling has been key for me as I grew up thinking potatoes and bread were bad! Learning that if my diet is based on the basic food triangle of protein, vegetables, fruit and carbs, I'll feel better and actually lose weight was difficult. Before I started my weight had been increasing and overeating was not a factor. Just poor choices. With Byetta and a healty diet, I have lost 30 pounds and am now ready to go back up to 10mcg.

My BS's have dropped from the 240 range to the 110-120 range. I am on insulin also and have had to reduce my dosage already. Being a nurse I was skeptical about this drug but each time I take it the benefits GAR outweight the side effects. I have never been able to tolerate the 10 mcg dosage so 5 is where I will stay. It also helped me last time (took for 3 months) to take only 1 injection every other day until I ot used to it.

"I was prescribed a cocktail of meds to treat type II DM one of them being glucophage (metformin). I was not compliant with this med because of very uncomfortable GI S.E.'s. I was instructed by my MD  to continue taking the med because there was no other med with the same mechanism of action. After changing Doc's and getting an initial office visit HGB A1C at 10.8 the Doc prescribed Byetta 5 mcg twice daily SQ
3 mo. later my HGB A1C was 7.3   WOW!!!!
The initiation of therapy can be difficult to tolerate...I stuck with it because I was told those unsaviory S.E.'s go away....Initially I had to take  other anti hyperglycemics with caution because my BS crashed---I must eat within an hour of injection.  The other SE is Nausea and feeling hypoglycemic I usually had to lye down for 15-20 minutes when the nausea hit.  However that symptom would last al most exactly for 1 hour then go away as fast as it came on ...I opted not to increase to 10 Mcg as suggested right away due to these S.E.'s...I found I started to skip the morning injection and would only take the evening dose and go to bed to sleep through the nausea ( for 2 wks).  This worked great for me because my body became tolerant. ( Literature states nausea lasts through the first month of therpy)
Well--this is correct I now can tolerate taking this med morning and night and DO NOT have nausea mixed with feelings of hypoglycemia any longer..But a S.E., I have noticed is Constipation. I have never had had issues with irregularity..Because this med slows down stomach empty-ing I certanly can understand why this happens. So I have to drink more water throughout the day.

"My A1c was 7.4 even though I was following the diabetic diet, exercising, 1000 mg Metformin 2x daily as well as 10 mg gliburide 2x daily. Fasting BG hung around 180. Started with the 5mcg pen and immediately I had to start cutting back on the amount of gliburide (reduced to 5 mg 2x daily). Nausea was bad at times but no vomiting. When I started the 2nd pen I got welps for about a week but applying benadryl cream to the injection site helped. Also, waiting an extra 5-10 seconds before removing the needle as well as turning it a quarter turn to be sure to remove all the liquid underneath the skin help.

BG fasting was averaging around 85 when I got the flu shot. Within 4 days BG started moving up towards 150-160. I called the doc and he said to just keep taking and bumped me up to the 10 mcg. It took nearly a month for the BG to start making its way back down (also had to go back to the 10 mg of Gliburide 2x daily). The average now is about 128 for fasting with an average of 117 2 hours after meals.

I really think the 5 mcg pen worked better than the 10 mcg as my liver still dumps tremendous amounts of sugar into my blood (dawn syndrome) on the 10 mcg. I know this because dr. only perscribed 1 pen of 10mcg to see if I could tolerate it. Once it was done and I was waiting for my appointment I used the refill on the 5 mcg until I saw him. He thinks it's just coincidence but I'm going to go to an endocrinologist for a 2nd opinion.

"I began Byetta 5mcg four days ago. I am  your typical resistant bullheaded diabetic -I was absolutely mortified with the thought of needles, scared sick of getting sick, and in complete denial that my blood sugar was out of control. Over ten years I had been given every opportunity to control it with diet, exercise and multiple variations of oral meds. It worked for a time - but unfortunately as all good things come to an end when I hit my 40's - they didn't work any longer and I kept kicking myself for not exercising or eating right. I very reluctantly, still whining and crying and yes - pouting some too -  agreed to give Byetta a try and WOW!That is all I can say and I'm a very wordy person as you can tell. I started my shot on Sunday morning with a BS of 403. Two hours after breakfast I was down to a BS of 286 and my nightly BS was 157. They had said you should see immediate results and boy were they right! And here is the kicker - I have not been sick or nauseated one single time - I credit this to my doctor who told me to eat smaller meals at first and to limit my carbs while getting used to the medicine. I already feel better and as much as I was told and didn't believe them - the finger pricks do hurt more than the shots, because the shots don't hurt at all! It took me a full 15 minutes psyching myself up for the first one and I couldn't believe it when I finally took it. The only inconvenience to this medicine is the timing of the shot with your meals and a little bit of heartburn at times. I am having BS's in the 150 to 250 range now and I'm sure I'll be upped to 10mcg at the end of my trial month and I'll start worrying all over again. But for now I am thrilled and thankful for this amazing drug. I hope this review will help you in your decision, because I read and re-read all 99 reviews on here when I knew I was going to be prescribed it.

"What a great drug! I had a predisposition for weight-related Type 2 diabetes. In 1987 i started gaining 20 pounds per month so went to doc who checked my thyroid function and then misread it (always get copies of your bloodwork!!), telling me it was normal. Over the next 7 years I gained about 140 pounds and Type 2 diabetes along with Restless Leg Syndrome. After getting my thyroid under control, I started on other meds such as Avandia, which nearly killed me via fluid retention in chest/heart cavities. In the end I was on Metformin (2000 mg daily) and glipizide (5 mg). When these weren't enough, my endocrinologist gave me a choice of insulin or byetta. I chose the byetta and am I glad I did! Have been on it since Nov. '07 and have lost over 45 pounds. Since all this weight loss and blood sugars staying normal, I have been having low blood sugar episodes down in the 40's and 50's. Solid food will not bring it back up quickly because of the slowed digestion process, so must resort to sugar drinks or apple juice. The low blood sugar episodes happen fairly quickly after an injection. It may be time to cut back on other diabetes meds. Endocrinologist fully expects the diabetes and borderline high blood pressure to disappear with enough weight loss. I had some light nausea when first starting, but it went away quickly. Docs advise eating only when hungry and have lost the weight w/o even trying. It does make you feel bloated after eating due to the slowed digestion and feeling fuller longer, but this is acceptable for the benefits achieved. My HbA1c has dropped from 8 to 6.1 in feb.'s check. I have no injection pain due to a numb spot on my stomach from a tubal ligation, just some redness and occassionally a minor skin tear from the very fine needle and not holding it completely still.

"Adverse effect of Cycloset, taken with Janumet and Amaryl

.8mg of Cycloset x 4 per day. started at 1/day/for first week, worked up to 2 per day second week.. Could not continue ramping up to recommended dose of 4 pills per day. Experienced chest pains, fatigue, upset stomach, vomiting. Discontinued taking pills. Felt great.

Spoke to my endocrinologist. She recommended ""sticking it out again"" to reach the recommended dosage levels of 4 pills.

Tried it again in 2 weeks, same results, but, incredibly, after taking the drug, my glucose levels actually increased following the 2 hour administration.
Woke up at 700 am, took 2 pills, took reading = 132. Had black coffee, 1 egg, 1 piece cheese. Reading after 2 hours = 198, with no carbs. Reading stayed high into the night. This effect was repeated for several days.

Tried same meal after discontinuing Cycloset. Initial reading = 135, post meal= 141.
This effect was repeatable during the 2 week period in which I was taking the drug. Perhaps if I made it to the recommended dose of 4 x .82mg, it would work, but getting there is not worth the suffering, and there is no guarantee it would abate at some point. Finally gave up completely. Hope this helps
 I was better off not taking the Cycloset.

"I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes over 10years ago. Earlier this year, my sugars were not under control, and the doctor put me on Glipizide 10mg (Watson 461). This brought my glucose levels back down. I then moved, and the new pharmacy gave my Glipizide 10mg (APO). After starting this medication, I woke up in the middle of the night with excruciating shoulder pain. The pain seemed to originate in the shoulder joint and radiated down into my fingers.

I then realized that I experienced the same pain when a former doctor prescribed the same form of Glipizide about 8 years ago. I had forgotten about this...but immediately stopped using the Glipizide. Now, after about a month, the pain has almost subsided completely.

"Humalog works far better than my previous R insulin because it works more quickly. With R, I would inject just before a meal but would get post parandial highs that gave me a headache. It took 2.5 to 3 hours for R to start working. With Humalog, onset almost always cooincides with digestion so I get a better experience.

"I use Humalog as a 'correction' medication.
Basically this means when my blood sugars are higher than usual, I bolus the dosage to bring levels back down.

My first time using it was last night when my 2 hour postprandial blood sugars jumped to 279. Within an hour after taking a shot, I dropped to 78. An hour and a half after that I was at 74.

I am EXTREMELY impressed as to how good this works for me. Only needed 3 units too.

Don't care for the 12mm needle. Will try the 8mm needle next time I am higher than usual.

I am hoping that between my diet and exercise, coupled with the Humalog, I can get even better blood sugars.

My last A1c about a week ago was 5.3, and that was with several spikes into the 200+ range, using diet and exercise alone. My goal is under 5.0 (4% club).

With this medication, I can vary my diet so it's not so boring, and not be forced to vigorously exercise as much to bring down blood sugars.

I am wondering something though:
Will I gain weight? Lose weight? Or maintain my weight when using any form of insulin?

Don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to 'paying the piper' (AKA exercising) after I eat. I have a lot of trouble fitting the needed time in to do it, and an even harder time getting back down to normal after a 200+ spike, using diet and exercise.

I generally have no trouble lowering my BS if I am 160-180 range, or less.

My fasting blood sugars are usually perfectly normal.

I can see some semblance of a life now that I have this medication. I won't do pills for my diabetes treatment as my blood sugars are usually well controlled. Seems heat & humidity (or a nap after eating) spikes me highly.

I really hope & pray that the endo will continue letting me have this medication.

I like it better than Humulin R which is slower.

Maybe get Humulin R for long digesting carbs like Dreamfields, and Humalog for the 'eat-N-go' carbs.

First, the amount of insulin delivered is variable on how hard one pushes, not on the stop position (unlike novonordisks or sanofi pens).  Second, the dosing ""arrow"" variably lines up with the dose amount.

"While the medication works fine, the action of the pen is mushy and imprecise, dampening tactile feedback such that it is necessary to visually confirm that you have actually administered the full injection.  Having done so, the springback on the plunger appears to suck a substantial quantity of air into the insulin vial, necessitating a significant prime to make your next injection accurate.  In summary, the KwikPen wastes insulin, it raises concerns regarding backwash sanitation, it feels wrong in the hand, and accurate dosage is hit-or-miss.  It doesn't matter how good the medication is if the delivery is substandard – and the KwikPen is markedly substandard.

I had hoped to speak with Lilly Eli and Company about the shortcomings of their pen, but it turns out they are not a feedback-friendly organization, so I'll have to settle for warning others about this problem.","{'effectiveness': 5.0, 'ease of use': 2.0, 'satisfaction': 3.0}",1/29/2016 9:17:08 PM,Humalog KwikPen subcutaneous,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-149828-Humalog-KwikPen-Insulin-subcutaneous.aspx?drugid=149828&drugname=Humalog-KwikPen-Insulin-subcutaneous&pageIndex=1&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"I highly suggest avoiding this medication if you possibly can. I was hospitalized for a week due to a poor reaction to this medication. I met numerous doctors as I was the first person in my general area of the country to have had the reaction. Thankfully I'm young so I managed to survive. I was told had I been 50 or more, I would've died. I had a severe amount of acidity in my blood, was acute ketoacidosis and I was in diabetic shock. Took Invokana for a month in a half approx. by the time it happened. There was no other causes of my ketoacidosis. It did help lower my sugar though. And normally I don't have negative reactions to medication. If you really need to take Invokana, I highly suggest purchasing ketone test strips at your local pharmacy and keep an eye on your keytone levels in your urine to hopefully catch ketoacidosis before it hits. If that's even remotely possible. But if you can take anything else, I would suggest doing so. And I'm not one to spread around fear in others. It is really a genuine warning.

"I was currently taking Amaryl 4mg twice daily and Janumet 50/1000 twice daily. The doctor took me off Amaryl and started me on Invokana 100mg once in the morning. After a month, I went up to 300mg once in the morning. The doctor warned me about yeast infections so I started taking Oil of Oregano. I took two, but once I started Invokana 300 mg, I noticed I was beginning to get a yeast infection, so I quickly bumped it up to 3 Oil of Oregano pills daily, praying it would work. I also started eating yogurt. I have been eating the Poplait light but the sugar content is high so I'm going to look for a carb friendly yogurt or the Total Fage Greek Yogurt. The yogurt and the 3 Oil of Oregano pills work for me I just had to be patient and give it time. Here's something crazy.

"I had hypoglycemia nearly all my life which switched to Diabetes 2 when I reached menopause. I started on Metformin 500mg 4/X day.

PROS: None that I can think of. If I stick to low carb, BS in <150 but probably would be without the insulin.
CONS: 1. I gained 15 pounds in 2 weeks after starting and I was losing weight at that time. 2. Water retention. 3.

"I had severe side effects I associated with this medication, Lantus Solostar. I had nerve pain, my blood vessels ""swelled"" and foot turned sort of purple in some places. Lots of pain and swelling in lower legs, could barely drive at times. I took it for somewhere between six months and a year. THings to note: Lantus (and most ""insulin"") is not REALLY insulin, it is bio-engineered and I wonder if that makes a difference. It is also preserved with a poison (M-cresol). But Victoza is also preserved with a poison (phenol, which was used specifically to kill people by the Nazis) but the Victoza seems to ""agree"" with me a lot more than Lantus so far. I don't know if these poisons (for example caustic PH levels) can be neutralized in the medications for sure. Or if we can neutralize ALL the negatives of a poison, as opposed to just some.  I think we need to re-think our medications and the way we deliver them. For example, why not use preservative-free pens that can be unrefrigerated for a few days, as opposed to weeks. I'd trade some convenience for safety. What about insulins that are not just ""like"" the natural thing, but actually are that thing? Bydureon (not insulin)does not seem to have a preservative and is used once per week, but may be hard to use for some, with mixing and longer needle. I notice people on this site have tended to not be long-term users and I wonder if that has something to do with all the positive reviews. When I was considering not using Lantus anymore, I saw another site where the reviews were much more like mine, they were very negative. Hmmm. That is what helped to convince me to go off Lantus even though my doctor kept urging me to keep giving it chances, and BOY am I glad I did stop it. Also note, it did NOT control my blood sugar, and I didn't think  increasing the dose time after time after time would make it work and I think I was right. I use Victoza, Metformin and Invokana now.

Doctors are baffled with my results and I'm frustrated after all these years with no good results.  Now I have no health insurance and search for new doctor. Thanks to Sanofi for patient asstance.  My two concerns with this medication is while I take 50 with no better results then when I was taking Glucotrol LX 30 X 2 and the crazy disturbing sleep pattern when I inject at night.  I may need to try something else.  any suggestions [email protected]","{'effectiveness': 1.0, 'ease of use': 4.0, 'satisfaction': 1.0}",10/27/2009 3:54:05 AM,Lantus Solostar subcutaneous,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-148652-Lantus-Solostar-U-100-Insulin-subcutaneous.aspx?drugid=148652&drugname=Lantus-Solostar-U-100-Insulin-subcutaneous&pageIndex=14&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

I start taking Lantus 1 month ago started out with 10 mg Lantus once a day & 5 mg Glipizide & 850 mg of Metformin twice a day. I did not see a difference in my blood sugars - found that if I don't eat or as much and am really carefull what I eat levels stay lower - eat anythng sweet and they are high- since starting I have not seen my levels under 150 - decide to go to specialist and get second opinion. Also notice since being on this I am weaker and by whole body aches - at times my legs hurt and keep me up at night will be discussing all of this with the specialist. Not sure any of this works - going to work harder and reducing my weight so hopefully will not need to take any more. Will up date after seeing specialist. thank you for listening. ,"{'effectiveness': 3.0, 'ease of use': 5.0, 'satisfaction': 1.0}",8/29/2009 10:29:11 PM,Lantus Solostar subcutaneous,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-148652-Lantus-Solostar-U-100-Insulin-subcutaneous.aspx?drugid=148652&drugname=Lantus-Solostar-U-100-Insulin-subcutaneous&pageIndex=15&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"I was prescribed this product because my A1C was 7.5. In my opinion Metformin acts like a super laxative if you eat greasy heavy foods. You will feel the affects if you eat foods like pasta/hamburgers as it will be hard to digest. Then what you ate, comes out in about 2 hours. Do not take Metformin if you are going to be out amongst friends/coworkers as you will need a bathroom and privacy. So schedule your Metformin accordingly. I do miss doses if I have to, but I never double a dose. It does not curb cravings and also blocks B12 absorption. So you MUST supplement B vitamins. I had some hair shedding, and immediately the B vitamin supplements helped that issue.

Also, i have heard that other diabetics have done better with a gradual administration of metformin, and slowly working up to the recommended dose. They say the gastro side effects eventually go away after a couple of months. Try taking with food.

Good luck. Your body, your science experiment! ","{'effectiveness': 5.0, 'ease of use': 5.0, 'satisfaction': 5.0}",11/10/2012 3:40:15 PM,metformin oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-11285-metformin-oral.aspx?drugid=11285&drugname=metformin-oral&pageIndex=83&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"Since starting this medication, 1/27/2012, for treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, I have experienced weight loss coupled with walking to help alleviate the excess weight I had carried for the last several years.  Since 12/25/2011 (approx.) I have lost about 25 lbs to date (3/17/2012). If Metformin has helped (along with careful attention to diet, and addition of exercise (walking up to 30 min. daily, weather permitting), I feel Metformin has possibly been helpful for me.  However, there is one issue which has caused me to wonder if the addition of Metformin to my daily medication needs has caused me to experience ""hot flashes"", similar to that of a woman going through menopause.  I am 75, and did go through a rather severe period of time when I suffered extreme hot flashes. Very essential surgery coupled with careful attention to the addition of Premarin completely eliminated that problem, for the most part. Therefore, I can say with much specificity, I know what it feels like to experience ""hot flashes"".  Only since I have been on Metformin, have I begun to experience this recurrence of hot flashes.  I would appreciate any information concerning this possibility to be provided to me.

A couple swallows before the pills helps to coat your stomach. I can not take this with water. Always heard to take diabetes meds a half hour before eating, but not this med. You have to take this with milk or with food, otherwise it will make you have a very upset stomach. If you can't do the milk, start the meal. Take the med after eating a few bites. You need to coat your stomach. This simple thing will help reduce stomach discomfort. If you eat a lot of fatty foods you will have more diarrhea problems.

If you take this to late in evening you may have lowered blood sugars to the point of needing to eat something. with me, its a 4 hour window, almost like some people on insulin. This drug hits me big time about 4 hours after I take it. Pay attention to what you eat. Moderation is the key to life. don't eat the whole cake, maybe not even a whole large slice, a few bites can be wonderful.

"I was diag'd w/PCOS and pre-diabetes almost 2 yrs ago and have been on Metformin since. I started w/500mg 2x daily and was upped to 1000mg 2x daily. The SE were horrible. My doctor just kept telling me that they would go away but they never did. I changed my diet and excercised and never lost a lb., my gym partner did the same routine and lost 20 lbs, my muscles toned up in my arms and legs but my gut was still there. Immediately upon taking the Metformin, I have severe diarreah and upset stomach no matter what I eat. I'm to the pt of not being able to do things bc I'm affraid I'm not going to make it to the bathroom on time. Some days I feel fatigued, weak and have the sensation of passing out like I have low blood sugar; this goes away after I eat something but leaves me tired for the rest of the day. However, my H1C is lower and since, my doctor has lowered my dosage back to 500mg 2x daily. My upset stomach has been a ltl better, if I have plans I just skip a dose so I don't have to worry about diarreah. Down side to lowering my dose is immediate weight gain on top of no weight loss = fatter. Also, I have had no changes in my menstral cycle which lasts up to 3 mos w/continuous bleeding that caused me to be anemic. I have taken Clomid w/no pregnancy and am currently on Lupron Depot (SE are like menopause)to shrink a fibroid and stop menstration.

"Originally took 500 mg x2; lowered level about 10. Discontinued it, and with diet & exercise, went from 175 -100. 1 year later,can no longer exercise (accident)& I'm  up to 300- 440. Now taking 1000 mg x2; sugar plummeted from 330-440 to 135-210. Same symptoms using Metformin as without, during the period when sugar levels are being reduced -due to body not used to lowered sugar levels - nausea, diarrhea, thirst, urination, etc.
We know high A1c levels damage organs, eventually resulting in death.  Do we know that lowering levels with drugs prolongs life, when it is not curing the underlying disease? If you live long enough, DM2 will eventually & inevitably take its toll, regardless. Evidence seems to indicate that careful diet (quality of food, low carbs, etc.), exercise, and using drugs as required can extend life for a while.
On side effects- I've noticed that without drugs, the DM2 population seems to have a high incidence of certain symptoms- the same ones reported on by those on medication. Perhaps in some people the drugs make them more prominent.

"Update from 2/10/11.Well I been on Metformin/Yaz birth control since Nov. 2010.I stopped taking Yaz on 6/27/11,hoping to get pregnant this year.My gyno Dr informed me after my check-up from my D&C, hysteroscopy,laproscopy surgery,that I will have a hard time conceiving due to the scar tissue in my Cervix from the LEEP procedure I had in 2007 to remove cancerous cells.So my hopes of ever be a mother was low,but I didnt want to give up.So me and my fiance agreed for me to stop my birth control and said if I get pregant great if I dont its okay too,and if after a year of trying we would go to a fertility specialist.I continue to take 500mg of Metformin 2x a day.I use the fertility Calculator on this site to find out when my fertile days are for the next 3 months.My cycle in July was on time but lasted longer since I wasnt on birth control anymore.July 27th I took a preg. test,it was negative.August we missed the week of my fertile days(7-11th) due our busy work schedules,on the 3rd and 15th we made time,I was due to have my period on Aug 20th,but it never came.My fiance was sick from 12-16th and his coworker ask him if I was pregnany because it could be the reason he is sick.I have never heard of such stuff,I thought it was pretty funny. According to Fertility Calendar I was to take a pregnancy test on 8/24/11.I been have dreams that night that I was pregnant,but its just a dream.So 530am Wed. morning I got up and took the pregnancy test and it came back POSITIVE!!.So I went and got another test,used the same urine I had in a cup,and it was POSITIVE! I sent the pic of the tests to my fiance and he was excited.I have my 1st Dr appt 9/19/11 w/a new OB to see our miracle baby.I've read that its best to continue taking Metformin through the first Trimester in order not to miscarry.I missed 2 doses yesterday becuz I wasnt sure if it was safe to stay on it,hopefully no damage is done.So dont give up ladies on trying,It can happen!

I was put on metformin and it regulated my cycle immiedetley. I also managed to lose 140lbs while on the drug. I initially started my lifestyle change November of 2009 and started metformin that foloowing January. I had a consistant cycle from January till August. In August my gall bladder was infected and had to be removed with surgery. That caused a little bit of fluxuation of my cycle. Other than that this medication has been a wonderful drug *for me anyways*. Not all results are the same I am sure. I highly any woman with PCOS and starting to live a healthier lifestlye with healthy diet and exercise should try this drug. It is not a magic pill.

"For the past 2 months, I took metformin twice daily at 250 mg for 1 week and 500 mg for the next 2 weeks, then 500 mg in the morning and 750 mg at night, to 500 mg in th morning and 1000mg at night along with 20 units of Lantus. The gradual build up  of the metformin decreased the gas and bathroom visits. Taking Vitamin B complex that includes Vitamin B12 and eating yogurt (100 calories) daily minimizes the strong gas. Metformin helps my liver from releasing glucose so FBG ranges from 77 mg/dl to 130 mg/dl. Still working on getting consistent FBG less than 100 mg/dl by minimizing carbohydrate intake at dinner, so most carbs are consumed before 4 p.m. Lantus and metformin worked, since I tried Actos, Januvia and Metformin for 1 month then added Lantus starting at 10 units when HbA1C was at 13 mg/dl. Talked with physician assistant to use Lantus and metformin but stopped metformin after 2 months with a urinary tract infection. Read the earlier reviews and decided to try metformin. HbA1C is 7.5 mg/dl after 10 months. I was diagnosed with diabetes 16 years ago and controlled it mainly by diet and exercise for the past 10 years till early 2010 when genetics of both parents set in - not overweight.

"UPDATE FROM POST ON 10/10/10 .. Well I went for my f/u appt on 10/26/10 after my D&C, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy on 9/16/10 the news wasn't good. My NEW Gyno informed me I had alot of scar tissue in my cervix that was due to a LEEP procedure in 2007 to remove cancerous cells from my cervix. I bled quite a bit during the procedure & my OLD Dr had to cauterize alot of my vessels in my cervix to stop the bleeding. Then after that I switched to depo shots for 4ys,I didn't have a period for 3yrs. So now Im diagnosed w/ cervical stenosis (narrowing of the cervix) which explains the spotting,and severe cramping and fluid in my uterus that was found during my ultrasound in Aug. Dr stated she had a hard time inserting the instruments thru my cervix during my surgery. She lasered the cysts in my ovaries and cleaned out my uterus.She said if I had endometriosis it was in the beginning stages.It was caused from me unable to release all my menstural blood b/c the opening of my cervix was so small.The severe cramping is due to the pressure of the blood trying to go thru the small opening.She wasn't able to exam my fallopian tubes b/c there was some scar tissue there. She stated I will have a difficult time getting pregnant due to the scar tissue.However,it is good that im spotting and have a light period, it means my cervix isnt completely closed, so there hope. She has prescribed me Metformin and Yasmin birth control to regulate my cycle in hopes of opening up my cervix. She doesnt want me to start both meds until my cycle next month in Nov. Im a little worried about taking Yasmin-BC, I know there is a law suit currently out there on this product due to the side effects.I researched and read post about Yasmin and most women dont recommend it.But I will put trust in my NEW Dr and see how things go, and will notify her of any side effects from the BC pill.

"Hello all.First all of I would like to say I love this website,so much helpful info. Aug 23,2010 I was diagnosed w/endometriosis and PCOS via ultrasound.I had no idea I had those conditions! I was on Depo Provera injections for 4yrs,Nov 2009 was my last injection and I havent had a period for 3yr 10mths now.I was taking birth control pills before the shots since I was 21. I am now 29yrs. Ive recently gotten engaged and we talk about have a baby in the future.Since I'm yet to start my cycle from being off of Depo shots, I had my doubts that I may never become a mother. So my Dr told me she want to do a D&C to clean out my uterus, and a hysteroscopy,laporascopy to look at my uterus and ovaries, that was on 9/16/10. So I did some research on this site about PCOS and notice the medication Metformin is prescribed for my condition and to regulate my cycle and lose weight. After reading the posts on here, it really has giving hope for me and my future husband to one day have a bundle of joy of our own. Im due to have my follow up appt on 10/19/10 and I will ask my Dr about putting me on this medication. The thought of losing weight for my wedding(I gained over 40lbs on the Depo shot,most of it in stomache area,also alot of facial chin hair) and increase my fertility all at the same time,excites me!

"I have been on the drug for about 6 months. However, working with my doctor and experimenting somewhat I have found the best combo for effectivness and less side effects. Here are my tips:
1. Gradually work up to the desired dosage. This may take you 1 week; for others 6 weeks.
2. Eat with a meal!
3. Drink plenty of water with the dose.
4. Meals that are high in fat (pizza is a killer!) and sugar (no dessert!) are what cause me to have the worse side effects.

Also the higher doses dont help. Thats hwere something like Lantus or Byetta combined with metformin will be better.

"I began taking Metformin in December 08 for Insulin Resistance Syndrome which is normally associated with PCOS. I found that not eating enough and not allowing my food to coate my stomache would cause me to get nauseous when taking my daily doses (1000mg twice a day). I started at 500 mg for a week, then increased to my daily dose of 2000 mg. My dr. told me to eat enough to make sure I coate my stomache and wait about 20 minutes before taking my dose. It helped significantly. I no longer get sick after taking it unless I didn't eat enough or allow the food to coate my stomache. My cycles used to be 7-10 days with heavy flow; it has decreased to 3-4 days with only one day of heavy flowing. The cramps during cycles have also decreased and are not has severe. I have not experienced any weight loss though. I experienced diarrhea about 6 months into treatment but Metformin has actually regulated me. Where I used to go once a week, if that, off my cycle, and once everyday while on my cycle. Now, I'm going on a daily basis. Overall, I'm quite impressed with the medication once my amazing dr. tweeked how I was taking it and offered solutions to get through the side effects. I would suggest patience and persistence with Metformin because in the beginning for me it was disheartening and very frustrating; especially the nausea.

My Dr. immeidately started me on Metformin beginning with 500mg/day for one week, increasing by 500mg/day each week after that until I now take 2000mg/day.  It took approximately 6 months for the Metformin to regulate my period without jump-starting it with Provera, when it did start I had a 12 day, extremely heavy period, and then 10 days later I had another 14 day period, the heaviest I've ever had in my life.  I had taken Clomid for two months before the Metformin started to regulate my period and it didn't work, so we waited until we got results on the Metformin for a couple months and then started taking Clomid again.  I have been on 100mg of Clomid on days 3-8 of my cycle and am in the middle of my 5th cycle on Clomid and Metformin combined (this time around).

I've been taking this medication for almost two weeks now. I started taking it one at night for a week which really worked and I had no side effects. Well I lost 8.9 pounds with the help of Atkins which I was already on before I started taking the medication. I am in my second week in which I upped the dosage to one in the morning and one at night. With the one in the morning I feel sick to my stomach all the time except for when I am sleeping which seems to be all the time. So I think I will just do two at night and hopefully that does the same for me because this one in the morning just throws my body for a loop. I have occasional upset stomach but not enough to interfere with my normal routine like the nausea. Hopefully if I take two pills at night I can stop with that and live normal. The weight that was lost was an extra benefit I can’t complain about that because I needed help in that area. ,"{'effectiveness': 4.0, 'ease of use': 3.0, 'satisfaction': 3.0}",10/5/2009 2:15:53 PM,metformin oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-11285-metformin-oral.aspx?drugid=11285&drugname=metformin-oral&pageIndex=205&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"In 1989 I took on new job and received PMR (polymylgia rheumatica); FMS (fibromylgia); and CFS (chronic fatigue syndrone).  I was given all kinds of drugs to try to ease the pain, such as Ultram and Celebrex, which only seemed to cause edema in my legs.  I was put on PREDNISONE to make me able to move.  Now after 75# weight gain from PRED and other drugs for HBP, antidepressant, etc. I have type II and am on Metformin.  This has been a disaster for me from the severe side effects.  If I could have a port-potty with me at all times, I could go more places....have had several very close calls to get in bathroom.  I am 61 on SSI disability for my health issues, now this one to contend with...and I can't seem to regulate anything.  We tried all different Metformin strenghts, etc.  None worked well.  So we added Actos for a month....only added 20# to my lovely ""Prednisone weight gain of 75#"" which I did not need or want either.  I gave up smoking in the past 2 years with the assistance of Chantix meds for five months with no weight gain.  My issue is I can hardly walk most days..do not exercise..and sleep typically avg. 12 hrs with Ambien.  I am now on Glipizide for past 2-3 weeks and only 1-500 ER Met.

"I was DXed with PCOS in 1999, I was put on Metiformin as an at-the-time non standard treatment.  Before starting to take it, I would have a period maybe every 100+ days.  very very irregular, after a couple years of monitoring and adjusting of dosage, i am on 1500 mg daily of the extended release.  I have lost and gained and lost 30 lbs over the last 10 years.  My avrage cycle for the span of jan 2007 to Dec 2008 was 40 days.  Still not pregnant, but we've stopped trying for that, and just trying for the health of my body, to keep Type 2 out of my life.  Over the years I have found that taking the pills with food helps, and taking it with milk (cerial or just a glass of milk) is best.  I can not drink alchol while on it, causes diareia.  Cutting back on fried foods and carbs also helps with the gas and diarehha. When I stick to whole grains, milk and fresh fruit and veggies with small servings of meat, I almost have no side effects, and feel a lot better.  I also found taking a multi vit or atleast a B complex 4 hours apart from taking the Met helps with the energy.

For those that are new to the drug, if you've been put on 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg, try starting out taking just 500 for a week or 2, then 1000 for a week or two then so forth, letting your body get used to the meds in small stepps, it helps.  Also, it can take 2-6 months for your body to fully get used to it.  it may be uncomrfortable in the mean time, but don't give up!  Pepto and tums will be your friend for a while :) If after a few months its still bad, and you are NOT on the extended release pills, ask to swich,  the side effects are much better.","{'effectiveness': 5.0, 'ease of use': 5.0, 'satisfaction': 5.0}",7/6/2009 5:29:31 PM,metformin oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-11285-metformin-oral.aspx?drugid=11285&drugname=metformin-oral&pageIndex=225&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"Metformin caused lactic acidosis. This medication did work for my mother without remarkable symptoms for several years.

She was hospitalized twice which required stopping the metformin and getting nasal Oxygen. She became Remarkably More Alert and less tired both time. Doctors did not think symptoms were related to metformin and ruled out cardiac problems. She continued the metformin until she developed low blood pressure and the shortness of breath became Kushmall breathing, deep labored breathing because her body was not able to use oxygen that she had in her blood and she died. She basically suffocated to death. It was horrible watching her die. ------Be very careful if you take this drug.

"I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes just three weeks ago, in early December 2008. (I self-diagnosed it with urine test-strip, and the doctor confirmed it.) My glucose and A1C levels were through the roof...A1C was 12.9. (That is not a typo...it was 12.9!) Blood sugar was over 300. Scarey stuff, as I should have been in a coma. Instead, I had no symtoms except for losing weight and frequent urination. I immediately had a massive change in diet, and started walking 4-8 miles a day. My doctor started my on the Metformin with two 500 mg tabs a day, taken at dinner. I have seen my blood glucose readings drop from 270 down to 90 within the past two weeks. I've dropped 44 pounds, (the last 15-20 have been from the diet and exercise), and even my blood pressure haas fallen 20 points. I have experience no side effects at all from the Metformin. None. No diarrhea, no nausea, no feeling of being tired...nothing. So I guess you could say that I love the stuff. I don't know how far my A1C readings have fallen yet, as I haven't had that retested yet. But imagine that they are well on their way to coming into the tolerance range. In addition to good food (no sugar, lots of veggies, lean meats, whole grains, a few almonds for snacking, etc.), my doctor also recommended that I use the Adkins products to supplement my diet when needed. I find the ""treats"" such as the low-carb desserts are an acceptable way to satisfy my cravings when the sweet tooth calls.

BTW, I had no one to blame but myself for the onset of the diabetes. I was a competitive powerlifter for 20 years, and was 5'-10"", 326 pounds! That's just plain dumb.

"After years of Gyno's not correctly diagnosing me, now at 38, I've been diagnosed with PCOS.  Same song and dance - anovulation, very rare periods, depression, quick-to-anger (overproduction of androgens, underproduction of other hormones)  Metformin was prescribed after blood work and other tests, and I've been taking it for approximately 3 months.  Now that my hormone levels are leveling out correctly and periods are normal, the downside is that I do have HORRIBLE periods.  So much pain that it feels like a miscarriage.  Time to revisit the Dr.  I feel a lot better, lost weight, metabolism has increased, and fatigue and depression has disapated.  Unfortunately, I have to get the laser hair removal to cure the lip and chin hair that was created through the over produced androgens from the hormone imbalance!  Anybody else out there with the same problem??  For those feeling the depression - you need to see your Dr. again because the metformin does not cause that - there is something else wrong.  Depression is from your unbalanced hormone levels.  I know there are two dosage levels, and you may need yours increased...check with your Dr. to make sure it's not in fact the hormone levels.  A Simple blood work follow up with your Dr. will tell.  I'm finding this condition is much more common - I just happen to be one of the unlucky one's with you to deal with it!","{'effectiveness': 5.0, 'ease of use': 5.0, 'satisfaction': 4.0}",4/10/2008 10:23:11 PM,metformin oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-11285-metformin-oral.aspx?drugid=11285&drugname=metformin-oral&pageIndex=307&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

"Hi, I like most women taking this medicaton was diagnosed with PSOS. I am 34yrs old and have never started my period w/o any type of medication (birth control, provera, etc.). I always felt ""not normal"" in highschool or any time after that. All the girl were talking about starting their periods and I never did. As an adult I never started which ment I couldn't have children. My husband and I went to see my doctor and he put me on ferilization pills. I was one of the lucky ones, I got pregnant the first series. Everyone always told me that once I had a baby that my body would straighten itself out. Well, dont belive them because even after I had my daughter my body went back to doing nothing. No periods. Even fertilization pills dont work now. I have tried at least 10 times in the past 9 years and each time failed. My doctor put me on Metformin for the first time 2 months ago. I had my first period 4 days ago. I was so suprised. Who would had thought sugar pills would make you start your period. It wasn't painful like with birth control. Just a little ache here and there but nothing I can't handle. Now I am just waiting to see if I can get pregnant. I am very confident, reading the other reviews helps keep me positive and I hope that reading mine will help some body else.

"I've been on Metformin for about a month for PCOS. If you are like me and have rarely any side effects from medication you are in for a surprise!  As soon as I started taking these pills I had nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite to my favorite foods and depression! I seriously am a different person while taking these pills.  I would start my day off with a small breakfast (cereal, fruit, and a bagel), take my pills, and go to work. I tried to be tough and tolerate my symptoms but I couldn't.  I really had a hard time at work because it made me so lethargic! I also had nausea and FREQUENT trips to the bathroom! If only we could get frequent flyer miles for our trips to the bathroom.  Just the thought of taking the pills now makes me feel sick. What I have learned is to not take the pills in the morning; continue to have a small breakfast but wait until you have lunch to take your pills.  This will minimize the nausea and diarrhea while you are at work.  Thereafter, take the final two after dinner. After I take my pills I have been drinking any type of thick, cold drink to settle my stomach.  I recommend a milkshake, smoothie or a green tea frappuccino from Starbuks.  For some reason, having this drink helps minimize my nausea.   My doctor also recommend I continue to work out while on these pills.   With all the nausea and diarrhea symptoms, who can work out??  Not me... I recommend working out first thing in the morning before you've taken this medication. Hopefully, I won't have to be on these pills for too long...   Also, don't forget to take some baby wipes with you to work!  You'll thank me later!

"I took metformin for 5 years and during that time I had muscle and joint pain.

"I have been using Novolog for under a year and the only reason I am using it is because my insurance company will no longer cover Humalog, which I have used for 30 years. I never had a problem with Humalog turning cloudy but in the past few months I have had to throw away 3 bottles of Novolog because they turned cloudy in the bottle. I am on an insulin pump and I change tubing every 3 days. The last bottle of Novolog I opened I filled the insulin pump one time and 3 days later when I went to fill it again the insulin was cloudy. The Novolog had an expiration date of 12/2014 and is control # BZF0540. The insulin is fine when stored in the refrigerator but I carry it in my pocket in a plastic case made for that purpose. I fill my pump 4 times from a bottle which should equate to about 12 days of use from one 10ml. bottle of Novolog and it is turning cloudy after 1 or 2 uses causing a lot of waste. I keep unused bottles in the refrigerator and 1 bottle at room temperature. This product is inferior to Humalog and I don't like insurance companies dictating which products I can and cannot use as peoples lives are at stake. I also have had days of high blood sugar until I figured out the insulin had turned cloudy and was no longer effective. What good is an insulin that only lasts a few days at room temperature? My doctor tells me she only uses Novolog when treating patients in the hospital and that Humalog and Novolog are basically identical but I suggest in a hospital setting temperature is more controlled and there are fewer variables than when 1 person uses 1 bottle until empty. I am also seeing bubbles in the bottle as well as cloudiness.","{'effectiveness': 4.0, 'ease of use': 5.0, 'satisfaction': 2.0}",7/7/2013 6:49:51 AM,Novolog subcutaneous,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-21781-Novolog-U-100-Insulin-aspart-subcutaneous.aspx?drugid=21781&drugname=Novolog-U-100-Insulin-aspart-subcutaneous&pageIndex=1&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

Like for breakfast and dinner.   Im on the sliding scale which is something everyone should learn about!   If you use this medication correctly You wont have any problems with it.   Most people never learn how to use the medication correctly.   or they complain about weight gain... If you start gaining weight  GO EXERCISE!   I work out 3 to 4 times a week.

Prior to taking this drug I had built up good muscle tone since starting exercising from May last year, simvastatin has virtually destroyed my muscles in less than 10 weeks. I only found out by doing research online that statins deplete the body of CoQ10 enzyme, which is essential for ALL muscles to function properly, including the HEART. I can see the obvious wastage of muscle on my body and limbs, what I can't see is if my heart has also been damaged. Why does this lethal medication be given out without at least us also being given the supplements it deprives the body of? I have now bought the supplements I need to try and reverse the damage the statin has done, I can't believe how damaging one 40mg tablet every night has done to my body. Hopefully the CoQ10, magnesium, vitamin B complex and drinking Apple juice every day, will help repair the damage caused by simvastatin. I have also found out that people who exercise whilst on statins have an increased risk of muscle disease/wastage, why was I not made aware of this also. I should have been feeling great, exercising 3/4 Times a week and eating healthy, instead I feel ill and in agony.

I thought I had ALS, MS, etc. Literally took 18 months for pain to diminish-got worse before it got better. Never contemplated suicide but when I could sleep I wished I wouldn't wake up. Took 2 1/2 years  (PT, ibuprofen, my own daily water therapy and vitamin supplementation) to feel somewhat similar to prior statin. First PT and rheumatologist blamed my arthritis and age? (50!-really!!) since they couldn't, and didn't try-no tests, to find an explanation (they wouldn't believe it was the drug). Second PT was fabulous and has even told me that since me the office is more aware of statin poisoning since I was adamant that I had a med reaction (they are seeing many cases of fit individuals having acute unexplained neuromuscular disorders who are on statins-they didn't look at meds prior to me so didn't put 2 and 2 together). Except for PT the medical profession did not help me with this horrific loss of three years of my life - if anything they caused it.  I expended a lot of money on self recovery. This stuff is poison. I wear a bracelet now to ward off the statin pushers. I think I'll take my familial high cholesterol chances. I'm of a mind that the high cholesterol piece is a scam - just as many people with low cholesterol have heart attacks and strokes as high - I haven't found research that clearly shows causation. Healthy lifestyle makes more sense to me!

I saw a report on tv about dangers of taking 80 mg simvasatin. I stopped taking it because of the muscle problems.  They eased and to my surprise, the fogginess I felt lifted also.

"I had previous sensitivity to statin drugs, but after 7 years my cardioligist wanted me to try Simvustatin. Normal dose is 40-80 mg daily.

"I'm now on Simvastatin (last three months) after being on Lovastatin for a year. The latter was so debilitating, I stopped taking it.  Tryglicerides shot way up.

I'm also disgusted with Simvastatin and ten days ago started taking half doses.  I could not walk any longer, right shoulder pain, extreme leg fatigue, and I've gained 15-20 pounds although my diet is almost perfect 'recommended'.  I can't excersize, I can't even even go grocery shopping.

These statins besides turning me into almost an invalid, have caused memory and congnitive issues that have essentially changed my personality completely.  There are other side effects, but I can live with those.

I'm comfortable with the normal progression of aging, and expect as I age to be able to do less...but I did not expect to become 'elderly' virtually overnight.

Although the muscle weakness and pain is supposedly a rare side effect, I have recently discovered that two good friends (in different countries) and my ex-husband have completely stopped taking them...in his case, he had to completely give up playing golf which is his passion.

They have all decided, as have I...that they are just not worth taking, even if they do work.  All four of us had side effects that forced us to completely surrender the lifestyles we were living.  Besides the golf thing, one friend had to quit working, another invested in a scooter thing...and I have no life anymore.  I get nothing done and every time you turn around...I'm napping.

I do not know if suddenly stopping the Lovastatin caused a rebound effect making the tryglicerides shoot way up, so I'm weaning myself off of Simvastatin.  Regardless...I'm not taking statins anymore.

But I'm wondering how many folks have also refused to take them, and stopped doing so.  In my case, everyone but one person I know have stopped except for one who does not appear to have any side effects from Simvastatin.

"Statins damaged my lungs (healthy lungs Nov 1994; fibrosis all four lobes and an area which looked like possible cancer - which it wasn't -on Xray ten months later). Quit statins shortly afterward; don't know why. Was off statins for many years because I traced my peripheral neuropathy to the same time period as the lung damage. No change in lung condition for years. Put on Simvastatin May 2009; May 2010, lungs much worse than before after being unchanged for a long time. Now permanently off statins.  Have researched what the cell biologists say about statins and it isn't favorable. Should have been taking at least 400 mg of CoQ10 while on Simvastatin, but that would only have helped me avoid the heart damage and additional lung damage the Simvastatin caused; the stirring up of a gene called Atrogin-1 is responsible for the leg muscle cramps I had while on the Simvastatin and the muscle weakness I still have. Wild horses wouldn't induce me to recommend statins to anybody - especially not a lipophilic statin like Simvastatin! Dangerous. By the way, interesting that the blog lines for people damaged
by statins are many and long, over 400 documented deaths from statins 1997-2004 have been recorded - and yet every piece of statin research (mostly paid for by drug companies) says Simvastatin and other statins  are ""safe"" or ""mostly safe"": doesn't this strike you as quite interesting? Also, research by cell biologists is now coming out saying that cholesterol isn't even the problem - but of course the drug companies can't put the Mediterranean diet in a capsule and sell it for a high price, or exercise, or a serene outlook on life, while they can put statins in a pill and sell them for plenty - and easy to scare people into thinking they need to take them. However, don't drop your statin on a moment's notice: you have to come off it gradually or risk serious harm to yourself.

"I was started on simvastatin in the hospital after a complete blockage of my right coronary artery which was relieved by angioplasty and a stent. In the beginning I didn't notice any side effects from the 40 mg. dose. It lowered my total cholesterol level from 301 to 147 which was great!. After 10 months it went back up to 201 which was probably due to my bad diet. So the doctors (both family doctor and cardiologist) recommended upping the dosage to the maximum of 80 mg. Immediately I started having muscle spasisms in my back that were so bad I was leaning sideways when I stood up to relieve the pain. Then I noticed pain in my left knee where I had never had any in my life. I had been experiencing this pain on and off for several months but attributed it to switching to a lower-riding vehicle and the manner in which I put weight on that knee when I got out of it. Finally, right after I started the higher dosage of Simvastatin I started experiencing shooting pain in my right upper arm when I reached for things behind me. Then I noticed that the range of movement of my right arm which I had never had any problems with before was about 60% of what it was previously. After an MRI scan was done I was diagnosed with a ""frozen shoulder"". I have been doing some exercises to try to fix my back,knee and shoulder pain by strengthening surrounding muscles and stretching the tendons in my right shoulder which have helped quite a bit, especially my lower back and left knee pain. However, now I limit what I do considerably to avoid causing any more pain or muscle spasisms which has diminished my quality of life tremendously. I am going to try the CoQ10 to see if that helps and, if not, then I am going off Simvastatin and just try to improve my diet by limiting my intake of sugar and saturated fat.","{'effectiveness': 4.0, 'ease of use': 4.0, 'satisfaction': 1.0}",1/9/2011 10:11:32 PM,simvastatin oral,https://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-6105-simvastatin-oral.aspx?drugid=6105&drugname=simvastatin-oral&pageIndex=80&sortby=3&conditionFilter=-1

The past two months one thing after another, stomach problems, back aches, pain in my upper thigh, now my arms hurt just to blow dry my hair. Speaking of which, emailed my Dr. last month asking why my hair would be falling out. Her response was normal aging. I could go on and on. Finally it dawned on me, maybe the statin drug could have something to do with all these crazy things. Went to this web site and sure got my answer. Way too many others have same problems to be coincidental. After another email my Dr. tells me to immediately stop taking it and come in for lab work. So the onset of side effects don't always happen right away. I was so happy with the way it worked but guess I will have to resort to the old fashioned method (diet and excercise).

"I've been on simvastatin for a few years.  Yes, it has lowered my cholestrol, HOWEVER, I have suffered from muscle ache and pain the whole time.  I made no connection tothe drug and attributed it to ""getting old"".  (I'm a very active, in good shape, 61 year
 old female) This past week I have been suffering with severe, crushing pain in my legs, hips and lower back.  I thought it was the flu, however, after seven days of terrible pain that would not subside with
any over the counter pain killers I went to my Dr. knowing something was terribly wrong!
 After full examination and many questions, he determined that this crushing muscle pain I was experiencing was a reaction to the simvastatin.  I have been off the drug for three days, and still I am in pain. Although it is beginning to subside I continue to have trouble getting up from a sitting position, and feel pain and weakness in my legs while walking, especially up stairs.  Sitting or laying down for more than thirty minutes is extremely painful, relieved somewhat by moving and slowly walking around the house.
I am not a whinner and have always prided myself in the level of activity I enjoy, but I must say that this pain was so severe that it has stopped my dead in my tracks!  I am hoping that I'll be back to normal again within a few days and no permanent damage has been done.  What I do know is that I am going to attempt to control my high cholestrol  with diet and exercise.

"I HATE hearing that generics are the ""same"" as brand name.  They are not.  I was prescribed Simvastaten, instead of Lipator.  Between the high insurance premiums, and prescription co-pays that we pay, I would love to take a generic.  I'm not prone to experiencing side effects from meds, but this one gave me severe muscle pain, and unpredictable weakness in my right arm/shoulder.  I could not lift my right are without a lot of pain.  Sometimes I would go to pick up something that I usually had no trouble picking up, and would drop it from sudden weakness.  My arthritis was also greatly aggravated.  I thought it was the natural progression of the disease, but now, seeing the difference, I'm quite sure the Simvistaten was making the pain much worse.  It took me a year to figure it out.  Talking to friends, and finding that 2 of them had to quit taking this (the only drug that we had taken in common) for the same reason.  What are the odds of 3 out of 3 of us experiencing the same side effect, that they list as ""rare"".  I wonder how many other patients out there are having debilitating pain, and weakness that they can't explain?  It's so simple to fix....just stop taking this drug!  I've been on Lipitor for 3 weeks now, and although there is still some pain, and restricted range of movement, there is definite improvement.  I am afraid that the Simvistaten may have caused some permanent damage, as I never had pain, weakness, or limited flexability before.

"Started taking this medication over three years ago and have experienced severe fatigue, muscle cramps in arms, legs, hips, and neck.  I have also experienced hot flashes and severe insomnia.  In July of 2008, I stopped taking this medication.  In August of 2008, My cholesterol level was 288.  Extremely high!  Knowing the side effects of this medication, and knowing I needed to reduce my cholesterol, I started taking Cholest-Off by Nature Made.  This product contains all natural ingredients including plant sterols to help reduce cholesterol.  The difference with taking Cholest-Off was that I had to take 4 tablets daily with a meal.  I took two with breakfast and two with dinner.  In February of 2009, I went back to my doctor for lipid panel/cholesterol blood tests. When I got the results three days later, I was blown away! My cholesterol level had gone from 288 down to 181.  The Cholest-Off worked beautifully with no side effects!  During this process I changed my diet and started going to the gym at least three times a week.  I still take Cholest-Off and will be tested again in early September of 2009.  My doctor was very happy with the results even though I never told her I stopped taking the Simvastatin.  Had she checked my medical records, she would have seen that I had not refilled my Simvastatin presciption for over six months!

Went into Dr. this week for standard lab work & follow up for high blood pressure, cholesterol & triglycerides. Initial lab work showed a great improvement in both choleserol & triglycerides.

He developed so much pain (including spasming) in his feet that he could hardly walk and it would keep him awake at night.  (But he did not associate it with the drug).
  I had been on a 20 mg dose for a very short time and discontinued it because I had developed numbness in my hands, fatigue, hair loss, significant edema in my lower legs, and increased appetite.
  I kept telling him about the things that I had been reading about this drug and he just wasn't willing to discontinue the medication, until he couldn't stand the pain anymore.  Finally, he gave in and stopped taking it.  The pain and spasms have resolved (within 3 days) and have not returned and it has been over 3 weeks since he did it.

"After many months of using this medication and having my doctor increase the dosage, we finally achieved the cholesterol numbers we were targeting.  Unfortunately, about a year after I began using it, I was experiencing significant muscular pain and weakness in my lower back (pain in muscles around my hip too).  I was in significant pain when I sat for more than a few minutes and the pain even affected my ability to sleep and exercise.  This pain came on slowly and steadily got worse over time.  Any physical activity would make the pain even worse.  I had difficulty straightening my back and bending over. My quality of life was terrible and eventually I was moving like an 80+ year old.  It took some time to figure out what was causing the pain because I was working with a spinal specialist and physical therapist and I trusted their judgement.  They asked what medication I was on and were not able to identify this as the cause.  Finally I figured out the cause on my own.  I did not correlate the two for so long becasue I had been on the medication without pain for many months.

"Over the past 2 years I've noticed a steady decline in my 79 year old mother's health. Knowing that during this period of time she she has been seeing her physician every 3 months, without a negative report, I attributed her dulling wits, increasing fatigue & loss of mobility to aging.  4 days ago my mother was displaying all of the symptoms of a stroke victim (incoherency, loss of mobility, etc).

I was very pleased.
However, then came the Corporate decision to cease producing Symlin in vial form and go to a inject-able pen delivery system and change/modify the Symlin strength/dosage concentration.
In my opinion, as well as other patients and doctors, it is the biggest mistake that could have been made.
A decision that as far as we can tell was made with little or no input from doctors or patients involved in the daily use of Symlin as part of Diabetes management.

However, then came the Corporate decision to cease producing Symlin in vial form and go to a inject-able pen delivery system and change/modify the Symlin strength/dosage concentration.
In my opinion, as well as other patients and doctors, it is the biggest mistake that could have been made.
A decision that as far as we can tell was made with little or no input for doctors or patients involved in the daily use of Symlin as part of Diabetes management.
I find the current pen delivery system inconsistent, not dependable and difficult to use.

"I've been Type 1 for 52 years and this is by far the best insulin I've ever used.  I've been on it for about three weeks with no lows - just excellent BG readings.  My insulin needs have also dropped by about a third.  And instead of split doses, my basal with Tresiba is now once a day in the AM. My doctor and I are both delighted with the results I have been having.  I'm using the U-100, and the newly designed pens are far above any others I've handled.  My biggest concern in the beginning was how would it be to work with a 42 hour insulin.  I would suggest reading Novo's full information on Tresiba before converting, because it does address this issue.  But switching over for me was actually very easy.  One important note in their info was that it takes 8 days for Tresiba to reach it's full potential, so  any increases have to be made slowly. I've only had to increase my initial dose by two units, one time, and at this point I believe I'm right on target.  My morning blood sugars are the kind I used to only dream about! :-) I hope more people are given the opportunity to try Tresiba.  As far as the rumors of sky high cost is concerned, the Humalog pens I buy are actually more expensive than the Tresiba!  So, don't believe every rumor you read.  Talk to Novo, and talk to folks that are using Tresiba if you want to know how what it's really all about.  My father had Type 1 diabetes most of his life, and his parents told him that in his life time there would probably a cure.  I've had Type 1 most of my life, and my parents told me that in my life time there would probably be a cure.

This morning issue led me to start taking some humulinN in the am because the peak is just right to bring down the rise while taking tresiba.

Adding Welchol has reduced total cholesterol to 168, 100% of which was due to drop in LDL. I'm sure the Niaspan and diet are gradually taking hold as well as my body gets used to them, but this dramatic shift to the first favorable numbers and ratios I've experienced in my entire life certainly makes drinking this horrible powder more palatable.

It's worth noting that one must consume a very large quantity of water throughout the day to avoid constipation while taking Welchol. However, adhering to this level of hydration plus the diet and even the Welchol have made me as regular as clockwork.

"Been on this med for a little over 4 months. Started with the powder. Worst stuff I have ever taken! It never dissolved, now matter how I treated it, it burned my throat, made me throw up and gave me terrible heartburn. I asked for the pill form after 6 weeks of trying to tolerate the powder. My latest blood work shows that my cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL have all gone up! Plus, my A1C has increased by 0.5%! But my glucose measurements are in normal range.  I thought this drug was supposed to help all of this and it has proven to do the opposite. I feel tired all the time, have terrible constipation and despite taking it 8 hours after levothyroxine, my TSH is also increasing.
Has anyone else had their A1C increase rather than decrease, despite their glucose measurements being in the normal range?
Not sure whether I want to stay on this medicine, but I had terrible heartburn that nothing would ease for the two days I took Previstatin and Zetia did not do too much (but at least I did not have side effects).
Doctor has now tried to get me to take omega3 fish oil capsules to help with the cholesterol, but I have to keep explaining that I am deathly allergic to fish of any kind and will not willingly take anything that might have any fish protein in it.

They don't add medications to your blood stream so this medication is absorbed through your gut into your bloodstream like other medications.

I cannot take statins, and from my personal research and 15 years experience working in cardio-pulmonary medicine I'm thoroughly convinced cholesterol has little or nothing to do with coronary artery disease. Consequently, when I next visit my cardiologist and he tells me my cholesterol is too high, I'll tell him I don't give a damn. If he want to argue the point, I'll fire him!

"I took the Xigduo for two days and progressively got worse.  After the first day, I was fatigued and felt a little dizzy when I got up to go to the bathroom (which was quite often).  I did not sleep well the first night but thought it might have been for other reasons.  After taking it again I started noticing that I could hear my heart beat in my ears.  It wasn't racing, more like a labored beating.  I began to feel like my upper body was being squeezed and had spells where I felt like it was hard to get my breath.  I felt like my lower mid section (intestines and kidney area) was putting pressure on my pelvic area of the body. I honestly had thoughts of my body being on the verge of death.  This scared me and I decided not to take the medicine any longer.

"I am newly diagnosed. I have found after a month my sugars are consistent. It does make me sweat like ""dripping"". I am also less tolerant to heat and humidity. I take my med before dinner it seems to work better for me. I lost 15 lbs the first 2 weeks! I am now losing about a lb. A week and are following an AD A diet.

"I started Xigduo XR the day after Thanksgiving (11-28-14). I was not feeling well to begin with and had upper respiratory/cold. Started itching with a rash after two pills. Discontinued and called the doctor. Tried the medication again on 12-13-14 and with one pill had a rash again. Thought that the reaction the first time was the other medications I was on due to the cold, but the second time I was off the cold medicine/antibiotic. This is one drug that I cannot take.
